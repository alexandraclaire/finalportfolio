				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p>My name is Alexandra Carter, and I like to eat a block of chocolate a day. Family size. Not completely unrelated to that, I've also learned to enjoy spin classes.</p>
				<p>I started my post-high school life by completing a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Auckland, with a major in Spanish and a minor in Euyropean Studies.</p>
				<p>My plans of speaking Spanish every day and magically becoming Penelope Cruz dimmed once I realised the reality: My choice of major was right up there with Philsophy in terms of utility.</p>
				<p>Enter Front End Web Development. I tried a short course and fell in love with code, which makes me an uber-geek, and also replaced my Penelope-Cruz-wannabe-status with a girl-Mark-Zuckerburg-wannabe-status.</p>
				<p>I realised I liked the nature of Front End Web Development, which was a perfect combination of creativity and logic, and also catered very nicely to my introvert and efficiency-angel (as I was dubbed by a former employer) needs.</p>
